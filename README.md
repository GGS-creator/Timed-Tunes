# Timed-Tunes
A small project to play music from an SD card using Arduino.
This project uses a microcontroller to run a program that plays music saved in an
SD card after a fixed amount of time.
The things required for this project are an Arduino board (UNO), bread board, 
SD card module, speaker, wire to connect the computer and the arduino board, 
male-male jumper wires.
The reason SD card is used to play music is because an alternate source of power
supply can be used to power the Arduino and the music will be played without
the computer being connected to the board.
